# Vinicius Rosa 
I am a software engineer graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from IFRS Osório. I always strive to learn and keep myself up to date with the latest software development trends. Currently, my focus is on improving my ability to write high-quality code with TDD (Test Driven Development), Clean Code, and Clean Architecture.

I am currently working as a fullstack developer in a Fintech company, where I am responsible for contributing to the maintenance and development of new features. We use technologies such as ReactJS/NextJS, NodeJS/NestJS, and React Native.
